# eipclean is a utility to search through a list of hypervisors, given a specific elastic IP address, to ensure
# that only one of those hypervisors are assigned that address.  
#
# eipclean will first identify the owner of the EIP address by querying zookeeper, and if more than one hypervisor 
# are assigned the address, eipclean will attempt to remove the iptables and ip entries from the incorrect 
# hypervisors, in order to restore proper EIP functionality to the address
